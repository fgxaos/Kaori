# Kaori


Kaori currently gets all its data from the website `https://myanimelist.net`, but this could be replaced in the future either by an other source, or by creating its own anime database.

## Pages
### Home page 
(NOTE: Some features are to be implemented on the website. They are marked with (TBI))

The home page is the first page that appears when the user enters the website. 

(TBI) A carousel displays the latest series that are recommended on MAL main page
(TBI) After this, there is a list of the "watching" animes that have been updated (aka. when a new episode has been released). By clicking on the name of the anime, the user can see what episode(s) have been released
(TBI) Recommendations: based on the animes being watched and seen, a few other animes should be suggested. 

### Watching page

The watching page displays a grid of the animes being watched (and not completed). 

Every anime is displayed in a Jumbotron. The available information on this page are:
* The name of the anime
* Details of the anime
    - Synopsis
    - Genre
    - Episodes (number and names)
    - Score, rating, popularity

### Seen page

The seen page displays a grid of the animes that have been completely watched. 

Every anime is displayed in a Jumbotron. The available information on this page are:

    - Genre
    - Episodes (number and names)
    - Score, rating, popularity

## Future improvements
Kaori currently only deals with anime, but it could also support manga and lightnovels in the future.
